        <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">A quick summary </h1>
        <p>Sounds of Chinatown is a collaborative, community-focused website and project that aims to record the unique
            sounds of New York City’s Manhattan Chinatown. Our self-guided "Sound Walks" offer short (15-20 min) guided
            walking paths that explore the acoustic environment of Chinatown.

            Our site also features an interactive Chinatown Sound Map [link] archiving the sounds of this unique
            neighborhood, to document the past and present sounds and noises of Chinatown. See the map here [link] and
            find instructions here on how you can submit your own audio recordings to be included on the site!

            This site is a means of thinking about Chinatown’s unique neighborhood in a different way. Our goal in
            creating these features is to draw wider attention to sound and noise as important factors that affecting
            individual and community health. </p>

        <h3> our mission</h3>
        <p> The sounds and noises in urban environments paint a picture and contributes to our memories about a specific
            place or time.



            Sounds of Chinatown aims to create a living record of the sounds that add to the unique culture and makeup
            of New York City’s Manhattan Chinatown community – recorded and described by those who encounter it. This
            platform is a space for visitors to listen to and to share their various experiences in and with Chinatown
            through the perspective of sound. We hope that the sound experiences and data found on this site will also
            help to draw attention to issues related to the impact of urban noise on Chinatown residents.



            The Sounds of Chinatown website is a collaboration between researchers from the Center for the Study of
            Asian American Health (CSAAH) at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Tandon’s Center for Urban Science
            and Progress (CUSP), and community stakeholders in New York’s Manhattan Chinatown, including residents of
            Chung Pak LDC, students with Immigrant Social Services (ISS), and… local individuals from the community like
            you! </p>

        <h3> site description </h3>
        <p> Manhattan Chinatown is a thriving neighborhood district within a vibrant and constantly changing city. Local
            residents and visitors to the area are exposed to a daily variety of lively and bustling sights, smells, and
            sounds as they walk through its streets.



            Chinatown is also a neighborhood exposed to frequent change as generations move in or grow and move away, or
            when older shops or businesses are replaced by newer ones, or when buildings are torn down only to be
            replaced by taller ones. Chinatown is also located in the center of downtown Manhattan, serving as a major
            truck route, with the areas around Canal Street and Manhattan Bridge being some of the noisiest in the city.



            In dense, urban environments such as Manhattan’s Chinatown, the impact of city sounds on residents living
            near each other and alongside major streets that make up this neighborhood is hard to ignore. What is more,
            being exposed to loud noises may have long-term health impact such as causing hearing damage – but noise
            does not have to be loud in order to be harmful to health. Exposure to any noise for a lengthy amount of
            time can affect a person’s quality of life and mental well-being. Take a look at our Sound Walks [link] and
            data collected about the daily amount of noise that takes place at a central building in Manhattan Chinatown
            [link] to learn more about how sounds (and noise) acts as a factor in how a community lives.



            How does Chinatown sound to you? </p>
